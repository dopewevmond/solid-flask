# Get solid understanding of flask

Not really building anything interesting here. Just applying Flask concepts that I picked from online sources but freestyling with them to get a solid understanding. This is a server-side generated project. Might do a Flask REST API type project after this.

## To work on this project locally:
* Clone this repository
* Make sure you are in a virtual environment
* Install all dependencies (which will be in the requirements.txt file) by running `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`
* Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add all the following variables
    * FLASK_APP=setup.py
    * FLASK_ENV=development
    * SECRET_KEY=`<some_secret_key>`
